    <h1>About BookHub</h1>
    <p><strong>BookHub</strong> is a community-driven online platform that helps students and readers buy, sell, or exchange books in a convenient and trusted way. Our mission is to promote reading, affordability, and sustainability through book circulation.</p>

    <p>Started as a student project, BookHub aims to solve a common issue â€” unused books lying on shelves while others are in need of them. By connecting people through a shared love of books, we create a win-win for both borrowers and lenders.</p>

    <p>ðŸ“š We host a wide range of categories, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Academic Textbooks</li>
      <li>Novels and Fiction</li>
      <li>Competitive Exam Guides</li>
      <li>Self-help & Motivational Books</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At BookHub, we believe that books should be accessible to everyone. Whether you're looking to save money, clear space, or share knowledge â€” BookHub is your go-to place.</p>

    <p>Feel free to browse our collection, list your own books, or connect with fellow readers. Together, let's build a smarter, more literate community. ðŸ“–âœ¨</p>
